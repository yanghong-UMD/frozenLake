# Frozen Lake Problem Solving Project

## Overview

This project implements some solver for the Frozen Lake problem. 

## Project Structure

### 1. Map Generator (`mapgenerator.py`)
- Generates random Frozen Lake problem instances
- Features:
  - Configurable map size
  - Customizable start and goal locations
  - Adjustable number of holes
- Guarantees a valid path from start to goal
- Outputs:
  - PDDL file (`frozen-lake-gen.pddl`)
  - Map description printed to command line

### 2. Basic Solvers (`Frozen-Lake-basic-pddl.py`)
- Implements basic solving strategies
- Configurable options:
  - Map configuration
  - Map size
  - Number of simulation runs
  - Planner selection
    - 0: Sample Planner
    - 11: MoveTo Planner
    - 1: PDDL Planner (not recommended with slippery conditions)

### 3. FS-Replan Solver (`Frozen-Lake-FS-Replan.py`)
- Implements Flexible Search (FS) Replanning strategy
- Configurable options:
  - Map configuration
  - Map size
  - Number of simulation runs

### 4. Q-Learning Solver (`Frozen-Lake-QLearning.py`)
- Implements Q-Learning algorithm
- Configurable options:
  - Map configuration
  - Map size
  - Multiple Q-Learning hyperparameters

### 5. Additional Solvers
- Includes code for Lazy Lookahead and Lookahead strategies
- Not discussed in the primary report
- Similar configuration structure to other solvers

### 6. Figure generation
- Figures used in the report are generated by the codes in folder `figures`.
## Usage

If you want to change any parameter, please modify those in the code. For the sake of the time, I did not provide any command line paramters.

### Generating a Map

```bash
python mapgenerator.py
```

### Running Solvers

```bash
# Example of running a basic solver
python Frozen-Lake-basic-pddl.py

# Example of running Q-Learning
python Frozen-Lake-QLearning.py
```
## Workflow

1. Generate a map using `mapgenerator.py`
2. Copy generated map description to desired solver
3. Configure solver parameters
4. Run and analyze results
